Recent Sociology PhD graduate from the University of South Florida with a focus on digital culture. My research agenda focuses on studying the impact of digital technologies on social interactions and relationships, currently looking at online gamersâ€™ offline and online social networks. My interests stem from the notion that in the digital age, we are continually checking the wireless devices that circumvent the physical laws of time-space and drown us with endless flows of personalized and pre-mediated information. We act accordingly to an individuated logic when both the devices and the data processed therein are representations of our tastes. These handy and convenient technological advances function as extensions of our body, thus carrying with them new ways of conceptualizing time-space, culture, information, and provide new spaces for social interaction.

Experienced Social Scientist with a demonstrated history of working in interdisciplinary and collaborative teams. Skilled in Quantitative and Qualitative Research, Social Network Analysis, verbal written communication, and self-management. Has worked with several software suites for research: data collection and instrument design; data wrangling/cleaning, managing, modeling, and analyzing large datasets; content/thematic coding, analysis and presentation. Passionate about society and its intersection with Information and Communications Technologies.
