abstract: "This study traces the boundaries of online-based social networks and its possible extensions and intersections with offline social networks. It focuses on the Massive Multiplayer Online gaming community. Most online gaming research has only addressed one side of the equation, i.e., the online aspect of social interaction, omitting the offline context. The primary objective is to look at both offline and online social contexts of gamers. The project was a three-prong approach.<br/>
<br/>
Friendship data using the Steam API was collected in order to determine which factors, according to the available data points, affect the formation of ties within the network. Biased net models were used to ascertain the probability of ties targeting similar or dissimilar others. In general, there was a strong probability of choosing similar others over dissimilar others. However, there was a group of gamers that owned over a thousand games that were more likely to have a higher number of friends than all other groups. Thus, aside from a general tendency to connect similar others, there was an evident trend towards connecting with those individuals with large quantities of owned games.<br/>
<br/>
The second and third prong relied on conducting an online questionnaire using Qualtrics and subsequent semi-structured interviews with some of the respondents. The analysis suggests that overall offline ties are slightly more important than online. Still, this does not imply that online ties are and cannot be as meaningful as their offline counterpart given the right circumstances. The length of their online relationships plays a significant role in how participants qualify their ties. Most participants that had not met face-to-face were willing to meet their online ties. They also reported having shared personal and everyday life matters with their online social network at a lower rate of their offline network. Time spent with online relationships stemming from online gaming and a cooperative environment was more likely to be considered higher quality time.<br/>
<br/>
According to this studyâ€™s sample, in general terms, there does not seem to be a strict difference between what they consider a meaningful relationship when it comes to online or offline social ties. There were participants on both sides of the spectrum. One side considered their online contacts more meaningful due to their ability to look for and find others with similar interests with more ease, while the other side made a case for their offline ties. An aspect that played a role in the deciding factor was the affordances that each medium provided. Most of the participants did agree that meeting others online was more accessible and more conducive to developing a meaningful relationship. Offline ties were slightly more likely to be considered more significant than their online counterparts.<br/>
<br/>
The modality by which one interacts with others is not as important as the content of the interaction. Offline interaction does present a more straightforward approach to forming ties, due in particular to the exposure factor (i.e., face-to-face interactions); however, as telecommunication technologies become more advanced and ubiquitous, the smaller the difference between online and offline. Interactions in MMOs shows a marked difference between other online social environments (e.g., Facebook and Twitter), in the sense that exchanges in MMOs can be continuous and allow for faster development of rapport in a shared joyful moment of gameplay. Even when the gameplay is immersed in violence, the main point is that gamers are actively participating in a shared interest, which allows them to develop interest-based relationships"
