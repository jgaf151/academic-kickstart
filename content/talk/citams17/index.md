abstract: "This study attempts to trace the boundaries of online-based social networks and its extensions and/or intersections with offline networks. It seeks to comprehend ties in online gaming communities who usually engage in Massive Multiplayer Online Games. Most online gaming studies have focused on the virtual aspect without seriously considering the intersectionality of the virtual and the actual lives of the participants. By addressing this gap in the literature, and attempting to design an instrument that will measure the extent to which online/offline social networks permeate each other, this study helps to advance the knowledge of this field. Social network analysis techniques were used to collect and analyze data from a Massive Multiplayer Online gaming community. The results show that participants seem willing to extend, or already have extended, their online social networks into their offline networks; which in a larger context supports the notion that online ties can be and are, in some cases, as meaningful as offline social ties. These results support the main assumption that a member who is familiar, has knowledge of, and frequently interacts with other members will be more likely to show interest in crossing the divide between their online and offline lives."
