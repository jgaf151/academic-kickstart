summary: The Puerto Rican vote in Florida after the 2017 hurricanes.
abstract: "For the last decade, the Puerto Rican population has grown substantially in the United States, so much that it has surpassed the Puerto Rican population living on the island. One of the top destination states of the recent migration wave, especially after Hurricane Maria, has been Florida. Florida has surpassed New York as the state with the largest Puerto Rican population.<br/>
<br/>
As the official date for the mid-term elections approaches, November 6th, researchers at University of South Florida (USF) conducted a survey to gauge the continental U.S.’s Puerto Rican population’s political ideologies and party preferences, including a subset of Florida Puerto Ricans and a subset of Puerto Ricans who moved to the continental U.S. after September 20, 2017, when Hurricane Maria struck the island. This report illustrates how Puerto Ricans feel about the two main political parties in the U.S., how they will approach the 2018 mid-term elections and their attitudes about some key issues at play in this election. It also includes information on how Puerto Ricans feel about the federal response to Hurricane Irma and Maria and their aftermath."
