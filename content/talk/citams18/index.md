abstract: "These preliminary results of interviews with several online gamers attempt to trace the boundaries of online-based social networks and its extensions and/or intersections with offline networks. In its core, this work elicited the interviewees to construct a narrative/biography of their top six friendship ties (three online and three offline). The study seeks to answer the following questions what the biography behind each tie in both their online and offline networks is? How does the participant perceive these relationships, and how does he/she manage his/her self-presentation when interacting with each network (offline-online)? A qualitative social network approach was used to collect and analyze data. Previous studies have proposed that online ties do become meaningful, but they usually take longer than offline. The results show that participants do agree that time and consistency of interaction are big factors; however, with the technology available today, online ties can be reached at any moment and can be more consistent. The results also support the assumption that online gamers who consistently interact with their online ties are willing to extend those friendships into the offline realm. "
